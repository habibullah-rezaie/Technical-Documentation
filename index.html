                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic
                    control over them.
                </p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended
                    for a variety of purposes by supplementing
                    it with additional objects; for example:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser
                            and
                            its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                            place elements on an HTML form and respond
                            to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                            JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to
                            communicate
                            with a database, provide continuity of information
                            from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                            server.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>
